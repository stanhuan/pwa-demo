      Hack the North is Canadaâ€™s premier hackathon, where 1,000 students of
      different skill levels come together from across the world to experiment
      and create unique software or hardware projects from scratch. We enable
      teams to make something great in only 36 hours by providing an abundance
      of hacking resources like mentors, sponsors, and hardware components.
      Sleeping is optional, but trying to make awesome things is not.
