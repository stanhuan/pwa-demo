title: Hacking
FAQ:
  - answer: >-
      No worries! It’s helpful to have some programming or technical experience,
      but it’s not a requirement. We’ll have talks, mentors and workshops to
      help you with your project; hackathons can be a great place to learn new
      skills in a short amount of time. Just come eager to learn, excited to
      meet lots of awesome people, and most importantly, come ready to build.
    question: What if I've never been to a hackathon before?
